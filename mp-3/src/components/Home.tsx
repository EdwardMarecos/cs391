                        Welcome to my website! My name is Edward Marecos, and I am a passionate fourth-year computer science student at Boston University. My academic journey has been centered around programming, software development, and problem-solving, with a keen interest in web development and exploring creative ways to express my ideas through code. Beyond the classroom, I actively engage in personal projects that challenge me to learn and grow, including building web applications, contributing to open-source software, and experimenting with new technologies like artificial intelligence and blockchain.
